        <h1>API Documentation</h1>
        This web page contains the documentation to Microballs' API.

        <h2>Authentication</h2>
        As of right now, you cannot create a microballs account that is independant of discord (atleast without the assistance of an administrator).<br>
        All* microballs accounts are tied to a discord account.<br>
        For authenticating yourself, you will need to use an API token, a random 32-character long string.<br>
        You can generate this token by running the /create_token command in discord.<br>
        As of right now, <b>all POST endpoints require authentication, GET endpoints require no authentication.</b><br>
        To provide an API token in your request, add the X-Auth-Token header like so: <code>X-Auth-Token: W&OT&1IsxyQ$5IxHrisdM2)i*9%I0G!P</code>

        <h2>Response structure</h2>
        When you make a request, the response will be formatted in JSON.<br>
        There will <b>always</b> be a "success" field, which is true if your request was succesful, and false if it wasn't.<br>
        If the request failed, then there will <b>always</b> be another field called "error" containing the, well, error.<br>
    
        <h2>GET /api/list_currencies</h2>
        This is the simplest endpoint.<br>
        It takes in no input values, and an array of currency containing objects representing the currency.<br>
        The index of each object is the currency ID.<br>
        The object contains the name and symbol of the currency.<br><br>
        Example request:<br> <code>GET /api/list_currencies</code><br><br>
        Example response: <br><code>{"success":true,"currencies":[{"name":"Micronational Currency Standard","symbol":"μ"},{"name":"Pur","symbol":"Ᵽ"},{"name":"Spilling","symbol":"Ł"}]}</code>
    
        <h2>GET /api/account/balance</h2>

        Example request:<br> <code> GET /api/account/transaction<br><br>{"id":6}</code><br><br>
        Example response: <br> <code>{"success":true,"transaction":{"id":5,"currency":0,"sender":679628927831900161,"receiver":548811963577401365,"amount":10.0}}</code>

        This endpoint returns the amount of transactions a user has made within a certain currency.<br>
        It takes in 2 inputs (currency and user) and returns an integer representing how many transaction this user has made withihn the currency.<br>
        Both inputs are integers.<br>

        Start and end are optional and are used to obtain a subset of transactions.<br>
        All inputs are integers<br>
        The objects returned are identical to the object returned with <code>GET /api/account/transaction</code>.<br>
        Example request: <br><code>GET /api/account/history/page<br><br>{"currency": 0, "user": 548811963577401365}</code><br>

        The buy rate is the rate basically means how much of currency2 is worth 1 unit of currency1 (eg. 1 MCS = ? Lunarian Spilling).<br>
        The sell rate is the opposite (? MCS = 1 Lunarian Spilling).<br>
        Example request: <br><code>GET /api/exchange/rates<br><br>{"currency1": 0, "currency2": 1}</code><br>
