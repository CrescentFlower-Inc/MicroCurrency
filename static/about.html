            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>What exactly is MicroCurrency?</h2>
            Microcurrency is a bot specifically made for micronations on discord or other mock governments who want to have a reliable economical system.<br>
            Microcurrency offers features that other often used applications do not have.

            <h2>What does it have to offer over something like UnbelievaBoat?</h2>
            UnbelievaBoat is a popular pick for micronations that want to have a digital economy.<br>
            However, MicroCurrency offers features that fits the requirements of a digital economy better.<br>
            For example, MicroCurrency has support for decimal values while UnbelievaBoat does not.<br>
            MicroCurrency also offers an API for developers to use when automating transactions.

            <h2>Exchange</h2>
            Probably the biggest benefit of MicroCurrency is that it has <b>exchange functionality</b>.<br>
            With the exchange features, you are able to easily exchange between different currency.<br>
            The exchange rates are also dynamic, meaning that whenever somebody exchanges one currency for another, the exchange rates change.<br>
            This opens up the possibility for trading currencies.<br>

            <h2>Open-source</h2>
            MicroCurrency is completely opensourced under the <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC1">GPL-2 License</a>.<br>
            This means that if you have concerns about the global micronation economy becoming too centralized around Microcurrency, you can just run your own instance on your own terms.<br>
            Another benefit of open-source is that the community can make contributions and that people can modify their own instance of microcurrency.<br>
            Unfortunately, if MicroCurrency becomes too decentralized, exchanging between currencies becomes harder and harder.<br>
            This is why we are considering making MicroCurrency into a federative application, meaning the application is split among several bots run by other people but still connected<br>.
